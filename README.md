# learn
a repository to keep track of programming related stuff I learn.

## this repo contains:
- language related content, notes (files in the root folder)
- notes, code related to some of the courses I do under [courses/](courses)
- some other algorithms I wrote to solve some problems that I find/found challenging under [code/](code)

## online courses I did, I am currently doing, to improve myself
