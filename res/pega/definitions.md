| abstract class                                  | An abstract class supports the definition of rules, including other classes. Rules with a class as a key part (including properties, activities, flows, and data transforms) can apply to an abstract class. An abstract class can be inherited by subclasses of the abstract class and can be a child of a higher abstract class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| application rulesets                            | An application ruleset is a collection of rules that identify the components of an application. You must be a member of a specified access group to work with an application ruleset The set of application rulesets determines which rules are reflected in various tools in Designer Studio, such as the Application Explorer, the Profile Explorer, and the Guardrails tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| application scoping control                     | The application scoping control is a reusable gadget that filters by application layer, class name, and specified search term. The combination of filters used depends on how the control has been configured. This control is used throughout the Pega 7 Platform, but is most commonly found on landing pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Application Validation mode                     | Application Validation (AV) mode is used during rule validation to determine which rules are valid to reference at design time without having to use ruleset prerequisites. Using AV mode offers performance advantages over the alternative Ruleset Validation (RV) mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Application-Based Assembly cache                | The Application-Based Assembly (ABA) cache identifies rules for which rules assembly on the current node is complete. Each rule that generates Java and executes is a candidate for the ABA cache. Note: ABA caching is the previous generation of caching technology for the Pega 7 Platform. UI (stream aspect) rules run using ABA caching, and all other rule types run using VTable caching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| association                                     | An association is a rule type that defines a one-directional relationship between two classes, used often in reporting to include properties from another class in a report. The rule predefines a JOIN-type relationship between instances of two classes, such as Operators and Assignments, or between cases and custom data classes, such as those created by data tables or external database connections. Unlike joins, association rules work automatically when a manager or developer builds a report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)          | Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a coding technique used in interactive web applications to exchange small amounts of data as needed, so that the entire web page does not reload each time users request a change.

In Pega, authentication is accomplished by matching the submitted user name and password to those stored in the users Operator ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| auto-generated                                  | Auto-generated is a term used to indicate that executable code was automatically generated by Pega, rather than being written by application developers. Auto-generated code is commonly created when configuring UI rules (sections and controls). When a rule form is saved, Pega translates some types of rules (such as control, section, flow action and harness) to HTML, JSP tags and JavaScript. These auto-generated rules eliminate hand-coding and usually provide better performance, security, browser independence and more consistent branding and styles than hand-crafted rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| auto-populatied property                        | An auto-populated property is a Page or Page List property that automatically obtains its data directly from a specified data page. The values can be an entire object from the PegaRULES database, or copies of pages developed by a Data Page rule. To enable auto-population for a Page mode or Page List property, configure the Data Access fields on the General tab of the Property form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Auto-processing                                 | Auto-processing is a feature that allows Pega to perform an assignment automatically under certain situations. To auto-process an assignment, the assignment must be configured with a set of when rules and corresponding flow actions. At run-time, Pega evaluates the when rules in top-down order and performs the flow action that corresponds to the first when rule that returns a true result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Autocomplete field                              | An autocomplete field on a form supports user selection of a text value from a list of candidate values. After you enter one or a few characters, a filtered list of qualifying text values displays below the input field. On an input field, the icon indicates that autocomplete is available for the field. You can configure styles for the Autocomplete control in the Skin rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| bubble chart                                    | A bubble chart displays three dimensions of data in a two-dimensional format. With a bubble chart, all three dimensions are numeric, as opposed to column or line charts, where one axis is numeric and the other is a category. The horizontal and vertical axes represent two of the three dimensions, as in other charts. The size of the colored circle, or bubble, for each data point represents the third dimension. You can specify the chart type and subtype for a report definition report by using the Chart Editor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| business exception                              | A business exception is an unusual condition within a business process that warrants investigation or external review. A business exception might indicate fraud, error, compliance failure, or other potential harm to the organization, customers, or other parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Business Intelligence Exchange (BIX)            | Business Intelligence Exchange (BIX) is an optional add-on product consisting of a ruleset and a stand-alone Java program that can be run from a command line. BIX provides the extract functions of an ETL (extract, transform, and load) utility by using the Pega-BIX ruleset, which supports the Rule-Admin-Extract rule type. Data is extracted and exported in a format suitable for use in popular business intelligence applications, such as data warehouses. High-performance, multi-threaded extraction operations operate independently of the Pega 7 Platform, and can occur even when the Pega 7 Platform is not running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| business metrics                                | Business metrics describe a company's case performance, such as the number of orders processed or how many orders are canceled.

| check in/check out                              | Check in / check out is a rule management process that allows application developers to reserve a rule for editing, to avoid conflicts arising when more than one developer simultaneously try to edit the rule. Upon check out, a copy of the rule is added to a ruleset reserved solely for the developer who checks out the rule. When the rule is checked back in, the rule is copied back to the original ruleset, overriding the previous version, and the updated rule is available to be checked out again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| checkin process                                 | The checkin process replaces a base rule version with a private copy of a Rule- instance that you checked out and updated. A checkout is a private copy of a Rule- instance that you update and later check in to replace a base rule version. All checked out rules reside in a personal ruleset that is only visible to your operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| circumstance                                    | A circumstance is an optional qualification available for supported rule types. Commonly referred to as a ""circumstanced"" or ""specialized"" version, a circumstance is based upon an unqualified rule known as the base rule. Using circumstances in your application allows you to easily support a variety of use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| circumstancing                                  | Circumstancing is the practice of creating additional variants of a rule based on specific circumstances, such as property values. When the circumstancing criteria are met, Pega automatically executes whichever version of the rule either the base rule or the qualified circumstanced version of the base rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| class                                           | A class is a collection of rules or other objects. Each class defines capabilities such as properties, activities, and HTML forms that are available to other, subordinate classes, or to instances of the class. Classes are organized into a hierarchy, where the system searches the class hierarchy from the current class upwards when looking for a rule to apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| class group                                     | A class group is an instance of the Data-Admin-DB-ClassGroup class and corresponds to tables in the PegaRULES database. Class groups cause the system to store instances corresponding to two or more concrete classes that share a common key format in a single database table, which is known as a work pool. The name of the class group is a prefix of the names of its member classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| class hierarchy                                 | The class hierarchy is a hierarchical structure that supports the sharing of rules and data.

| class inheritance                               | Class inheritance is the method by which a child class can use all of the rules defined for a parent class. The Pega 7 Platform supports two types of class inheritance: directed inheritance and pattern inheritance. Both types of class inheritance allow rules of ancestor classes to be inherited. However, class inheritance does not apply to external classes, even if the class name contains a hyphen. A class groups a collection of rules or other objects. Each class defines capabilities (rules that include properties, activities, and HTML forms) that are available to other, subordinate classes, or to instances of the class. Classes are organized into a hierarchy, where the system searches the class hierarchy from the current class upwards when looking for a rule to apply. A class is an instance of the Rule-Obj-Class rule type.        |
| class name prefix                               | A class name prefix is used during pattern inheritance when the Pega 7 Platform searches the class structure to find a rule using a sequence of prefixes of the class name. The hyphen delimits segments of the name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| coefficient                                     | In Decision Management, a coefficient is a weight used for each predictor in the logistic regression formula. The coefficient indicates the importance of a predictor. Negative coefficients imply the presence of predictors with a very similar behavioral profile, and their presence may lead to over fitting and unreliable models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Coefficient of Concordance (CoC)                | In Decision Management, the Coefficient of Concordance (CoC) is a non-parametric coefficient statistic that is used to measure and compare predictive models. The CoC can measure how well the scores generated by the predictive model separate positive from negative outcome cases. These coefficients are sensitive to the complete range of score bands regardless of their distribution. The CoC can vary between 50% a random distribution of positive and negative cases by score band and 100% a perfect separation. The minimum is 50% because the scores are simply used in reverse if a set of scores orders negative cases before positive cases. If the desired operational circumstances volume or quality of business are unknown, CoC generates powerful and generalized models.                                                                         |

| Computer Telephony Integration (CTI)            | Computer Telephony Integration is a technology that enables computer applications to interact with telephony systems. For example, a desktop application may use CTI to control a users telephone and place calls. In call centers, CTI software allows applications to monitor and act upon calls (such as transferring a call). Using PegaCALL, Customer Service supports CTI capabilities such as screen pops and desktop telephony control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| connection pooling                              | Connection pooling refers to a cache of database connections that are maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required. Connection pools are designed to improve performance by minimizing the opening, closing, or maintaining of a separate database connection for each requestor. When using connection pooling, a database connection is returned to a pool when no longer needed by a requestor and made available for future requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| connector                                       | On a flow diagram, a connector is a line that connects two shapes. Typically, connectors leaving an assignment shape represent flow actions. Other connectors might link to a When condition rule. The term connector is used in following two way. First, a connector is a programmatic component that defines and implements an interface between a Pega 7 Platform application that is acting as a client, and an external system that is acting as a server. A connector is implemented by any of the rule types in the Integration Connectors category. Secondly, you can use the Connector and Metadata wizard to develop many connectors without entering class rules, properties, or connector rules. You can also create SOAP, REST, and SAP connectors directly from the Connectors landing page.                                                               |
| connector (rule)                                | A connector rule is a type of integration rule that allows an application, acting as a client, to interact with an external system or database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Connector & Metadata wizard                     | The Connector and Metadata wizard imports information about an external application or system and configures direct table access without the need for SQL connector rules. This wizard generates connector rules or data mapping rules and creates a data class for each table in the database we want to work with, creates properties in our data classes for each column in the tables we want to interact with and creates the activities that allow applications to interact with the database in an external system such as create, read, update, and delete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| correspondence type                             | The correspondence type defines whether a correspondence is a printed letter, a fax, an email, or a text message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| cover                                           | A cover is a case that is a parent to one or more related cases. Typically, one work party, such as the customer party, is present in the cover case and in all of the covered cases that are associated with it. The covered cases are the children in a parent-child relationship. A cover can be a parent of other cover objects (and their children). Use a case type rule in the cover class to define the covered objects for the parent cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Data Table wizard                               | The Data Table wizard accelerates the creation of properties in a concrete data class by generating the class and supporting rules to make the data table an interactive data entry tool. This enables business users to use the Data Table Editor to interactively enter, update and delete database table items for classes that have a simple structure. The tool creates a concrete data class and the properties in the data class, list rules, editing rules, validation rules, and a data transform rule to supply initial values for properties. Optionally, it can also create a dedicated table in the Pega database and a corresponding database table data instance.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| data transform (model)                          | A data transform (model) is a rule used to set default values for properties on a clipboard page, copy one clipboard page to another, map properties from one page to another, append properties from one Page List property to another, and iterate over pages in a Page List property to map data on each page. These rules define a sequence of steps, and are executed in order, except when a conditional action, such as a when condition or a transition action, is encountered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| decision (category)                             | A decision category is a grouping of types of records in Pega that automate decision-making to enforce business rules and statements of policy. Decision rules describe a set of comparisons, each one consists of one or more conditions and a return result. When evaluated, Pega identifies the most valid condition and returns the corresponding outcome, such as an expense report that does not exceed $400, then additional approval is not required. There are four types of decision rules in Pega; when, decision table, decision tree, and map value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| declare page                                    | A declare page rule creates a read-only page on the clipboard that is available to multiple requestors in an application. Typically used to store data that changes infrequently and is needed by more than one user. For example, a page may contain daily prices for a set of commodities or currencies, an organization chart or inventory quantity data extracted hourly from an external system. These pages can be globally"" available to all requestors on a node.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Direct Feedback feature                         | The Direct Feedback feature, intended for use with the Project Management Framework (PMF), allows users, testers, and developers working with your system to record and submit ideas, suggestions, bugs, issues, and proposed solutions through a real-time connection to the framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| directed inheritance                            | Directed inheritance is the method by which a class inherits characteristics directly from a specified parent class, regardless of any defined pattern inheritance. For example, the PegaSample-CustomerRequest class (part of the PegaSample sample application) employs directed inheritance, and its directed parent class is Work-Cover-DupByCus. Based on pattern inheritance, the parent class is Work-Object-.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Dynamic Layout                                  | A dynamic layout is a DIV-based layout that allows for the flexible display of content. Dynamic layouts separate content and presentation. You add content, such as properties, controls, dynamic containers, and other sections, to a dynamic layout within a section. You set the presentation of that content by using dynamic layout formats specified in the skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Dynamic Select control                          | The Dynamic Select control is an optional feature you can add to user forms (through HTML rules, harnesses, or sections) and other HTML forms to speed user input. The Dynamic Select control is deprecated, but supported. Use the Dropdown control (pxDropdown) instead. As a best practice, upgrade Dynamic Select controls to Dropdown controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Dynamic System Settings                         | Dynamic System Settings data instances are used to alter the performance of the Pega 7 Platform. Dynamic System Settings that have Pega-Engine as the Owning RuleSet and key names that start with prconfig are known as prconfig settings. Creating a Dynamic System Setting data instance and setting the value of the data instance to a prconfig setting value is recommended over directly updating prconfig settings for easier maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Elaboration phase                               | The Elaboration phase of the Pega BPM implementation methodology is when a business analyst works with the customer to analyze the problem domain, establish a sound architectural foundation, develop the project plan and eliminate the highest risk elements of the project. These activities ensure that the architecture, requirements and plans are stable enough, and the risks are sufficiently mitigated, to predictably determine the cost and schedule for the completion of the development. The output from this phase includes a use-case model (80% complete), software architectural description, executable prototype, a development plan and a revised risk list and business case. At the end of this phase, the hard engineering� is considered complete and the decision is made whether or not to commit to the Construction and Transition phases. |
| embed- base class                               | The Embed- base class is a parent to other classes that, by design, are never to be used as top-level structures. No saved instances of concrete Embed- classes ever exist. A class derived from the Embed- base class is used only for embedded clipboard pages. Developers can create rules that apply to embedded instances and execute on the clipboard instances of the Embed- class, but the embedded instance is either saved as a page within another object or is not saved at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Global resource setting                         | A global resource setting is a property value on a data page that is referenced through specific syntax on a connector rule, or by a data instance that supports a connector. A global resource setting can reference any property of the appropriate type on a data page. The use of global resources settings for references to external systems, rather than fixed text values in rule forms, allows greater flexibility for changing values such as port numbers, addresses, and URLs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| handle                                          | A handle is a permanent, unique identifier for a class that includes certain key parts, and the creation date and time of a single instance for rules and some classes. A handle is sometimes known as an internal key. The pzInsKey property holds the handle value for an object. The pzInsKey property is undefined until you save the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| harness                                         | A harness defines a run-time form and is an instance of the Rule-HTML-Harness rule type. Each harness defines the appearance and behavior of a form. Harnesses are defined on the Harness rule form that at run time produces a user form, rule form, or composite portal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Headless application                            | A headless application uses flows and other elements, but either does not have a user interface, or presents forms, assignments, and other information to users through an external mechanism. An application that delivers straight-through processing can be characterized as headless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| heat map                                        | A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the values taken by a variable in a two-dimensional map are represented by colors. From the Heat Map tab on the Application Inventory landing page, you can view a heat map of the rule types in your application, summarized by category                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Historical processing                           | Historical processing is a feature that enables an application (for the current requestor) to operate based on how rules were defined on a specific date. Such processing is useful to reconstruct past behavior or apply past policies. Historical processing applies to an entire ruleset version, not a single rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| History type                                    | The history type of a history instance for a case identifies the event that corresponds to the instance. The history type is recorded as a single letter value in the pyHistoryType property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| History- base class                             | The History- base class is an abstract class that is parent to numerous other classes that define cumulative tracking data about the objects in your application, including rule instances. History instances identify the date, time, and user who updated a work item, rule, or other object in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| History- classes                                | History- classes are subclasses created automatically as a byproduct of the creation of other classes, to track changes to rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| HTML 5                                          | HTML5 is the 5th iteration of the HTML standard set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which includes standards to enforce cross-browser compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| HTML fragment                                   | An HTML fragment is a rule that defines reusable HTML not associated with a specific class, often used for frequently used HTML text, JavaScript or CSS text. HTML fragment rules are listed in the Technical rule category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| implementation class                            | An implementation class defines the extension, reuse, and specialization of assets in a framework class layer to meet the business requirements of an organization, division, or organization unit. Implementation classes belong to the implementation layer of an application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| implementation layer                            | The implementation layer contains application elements that are specialized for a specific business audience or purpose. The contents of the implementation layer extend the elements of the framework to create a composite application that targets a specific organization or division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| implementation methodology                      | An implementation methodology is a software development methodology that focuses on project management, return on investment, conformance to best practices and compliance requirements, communication with stakeholders, and the creation of physical artifacts that help to ensure project success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Inception phase                                 | The Inception phase of the Pega BPM implementation methodology is where you identify the business case and success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.). To complement the business case, a basic specification model, project plan, initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features) are generated. After these are completed, the project is checked against the following criteria: Stakeholder concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| index                                           | An index is a value that identifies one element (or member) of an aggregate data structure. These indexes are sometimes called subscripts. In addition, an index is a PegaRULES database feature that provides faster access and improved database performance. Use Declare Index rules to add and delete index objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Index- base class                               | The Index- base class is an abstract class that is the ancestor of other concrete classes that define indexes, sometimes called secondary or alternate keys, that are stored in the PegaRULES database. These alternate keys are used by the system to speed searches and provide sorted lists to help users find instances (such as work items) where the external key is not known but some other fact or property is known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| indirect page                                   | An indirect page is a page that the system finds by searching the clipboard at run time. The page reference to an indirect page starts with the keyword prompt followed by the page name. This type of page is deprecated but still supported for rules that used this feature prior to Pega 7.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| inheritance                                     | Inheritance is the mechanism by which a child class can use all of the rules defined for a parent class. Pega supports two types of inheritance:;pattern inheritance and directed inheritance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| instance                                        | An instance is a durable, potentially permanent, saved representation of a concrete class that is stored in the database. An instance corresponds to a row in the relational database, or to a record. An instance consists of properties and values, and some of these property values form a unique key to the instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| interest page                                   | An interest page is the primary page that a flow runs against. An interest page might be an embedded page of the case, or it might be the case itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| interested party                                | An interested party is a work party whose role is to receive information about a case. This party does not actively participate in processes or directly influence the outcome of the work. For example, the spouse of a cardholder can be an interested party in a credit card dispute. By default, you can associate more than one interested party with a case type in your application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| internal class                                  | An internal class is a concrete class (instance of the Rule-Obj-Class rule type) for which instances are stored in the PegaRULES database, rather than in an external database. The properties @baseclass.pzInsKey and @baseclass.pxObjClass are defined for every internal class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| internal key                                    | The internal key of an instance is the text value of a reserved property @baseclass.pzInsKey. This property is defined in the ultimate base class and is available in every class. This value is also known as the handle. For rule instances, the date and time that the rule was first saved becomes a portion of the internal key. As a result, the pzInsKey property is undefined until the new rule instance is saved and committed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| legacy agent                                    | A legacy agent is an agent where the Queue Mode setting on the Schedule tab is set to Legacy. Legacy agents do not use queues, and instead process each item to completion in a single pass. Agents created in releases before PRPC Version 5.4 appear as legacy agents in later releases, until they are upgraded to Standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Level-1 specification                           | A level-1 specification is a high-level specification created during the Inception phase. Level-1 specifications contain sufficient information to facilitate project sizing, but may be missing key implementation details. These application specification rules are later iterated upon in DCO sessions and become level-2 specifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Level-2 specification                           | A level-2 specifricatiaon is more-detailed specification (when compared to a level-1 specification) that is the result of a DCO session. In DOC sessions, the level-1 specifications are iterated upon to identify and address gaps in the content of the specification. The result of this iteration is a more-detailed level-2 specification. Llevel-2 specifications contain enough information for business and system architects to create the process and/or UI described by the specification, and for QA to create test scripts to test the implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Report definitions automatically use lightweight lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| likelihood                                      | A likelihood is a value between 1 and 100, interpreted as an assumed or known probability associated with a flow action. For example, a likelihood of 66 on a flow action labeled Accept means that users completing an assignment linked to that flow action are expected to choose the Accept flow action two out of three times. When editing a flow in Process Modeler, click the percent sign icon to display likelihood values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Operators are implemented in your application as instances of the the Data-Admin-Operator-ID class. To view a list of the available operators, open the Designer Studio > Org & Security > Organization > Operators landing page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| operator menu                                   | An operator menu provides access to your operator profile and a number of features, depending on where you access the menu and your application configuration. You can access the operator menu by clicking your name in Designer Studio, Pega Express, and the Case Manager, CaseWorker, WorkManager, and Manager portals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

All features are present, but performance is typically constrained by the laptop or workstation's memory and disk capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| personal ruleset                                | A personal ruleset contains copies of rule instances. Personal rulesets are used with the check out and check in features. A personal ruleset is sometimes called a private ruleset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| pinned class                                    | A pinned class allows you to access objects across inheritance hierarchies without explicitly switching contexts. Pinned classes are stored by access group for your operator ID and persist between sessions until removed. To pin a class, add it to the static Pinned Classes section of the Application Explorer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| population                                      | In Pega Marketing, a population is a group of cases with known behavior which is consistent with another group of cases whose behavior is to be predicted. In predictive analytics, samples are extracted for modeling and validation from the population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| portal                                          | Portals provide intuitive, results-focused workspaces that support developers with the Designer Studio, and users that manage cases with the Case Manager and mobile portals. Information in the user's access group, referencing a portal rule (Rule-Portal rule type), governs the appearance and functions of the portals that are available to that user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| portal gadget                                   | A gadget provides a rectangular area on a traditional ('fixed') portal (as opposed to a composite portal). Each gadget contains a control that a user can interact with. For example, the worklist area of the worker's home page is implemented through a gadget. Gadgets are defined through activities that apply to the Data-Gadget class. By creating a portal rule (Rule-Portal rule type), a developer determines which gadgets are visible to which groups of users. Using such rules, you can control the appearance, labeling, and location of gadgets on a portal layout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| prconfig setting                                | A prconfig setting is a name-value pair that affects the operation of a Pega 7 Platform system. Many prconfig settings have a default value. If no other value is explicitly assigned, the default value is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Pre-inception                                   | Pre-inception are project processes that occur prior to the Inception phase in Pega BPM. These usually include pre-sales activities and are primarily performed by Sales Executives, Sales Consultants and/or Practice Leaders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| precondition                                    | A precondition is a reference to a when condition rule (Rule-Obj-When rule type) or an expression that evaluates to True or False that is associated with one step of an activity. After the previous step of an activity runs, but before the method in the current step runs, the system evaluates the when condition or expression. If the result is false, this step is skipped and processing continues at the next numbered step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| prediction                                      | In Decision Management, a prediction is a specific to a form of behavior that is expected at a given point in time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Predictive Analytics Director (PAD)             | In Decision Management, the Predictive Analytics Director (PAD) is a separate Pega application used to develop and create predictive models. These models are used to create and define predictive model rules, which can then be used directly in flows, or combined with other components in a strategy.

| predictive power                                | In Decision Management, predictive power is a measure of the ability of a scoring model to separate cases with a positive outcome from those with a negative outcome using behavior defined in terms of two opposite types of outcomes; either a symbol to indicate the type of behavior or the probability of being one of the types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| predictor                                       | In Decision Management, a predictor is a property having a predictive relationship with the outcome. Predictors contain information available about the cases whose values may potentially show some association with the behavior you are trying to predict. Examples include: Demographic - age, gender and marital status. Geo-demographic - home address and employment address. Financial - income and expenditure. Activity or transaction information - the amount of a loan taken out or the price of the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Property Optimizer                              | The Property Optimizer is a tool that you can use to optimize, or expose, a Single Value property so that the property values are stored as a column in a database table, in addition to the Storage Stream BLOB. Optimizing a property improves the efficiency of data retrieval for reporting. The Property Optimizer tool creates an exposed column or a declarative index, changes the database schema, and populates the new column or table with values for existing class instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A service level for a case is defined as part of the case. A service level for an assignment is defined with a service level rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| service level (rule)                            | A service level rule is used to define the time interval required to complete an assignment. It includes one or two time intervals, known as goals and deadlines, which indicate the expected or targeted turnaround time for the assignment or time to resolution for the case. See deadline and goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Service Level Agreement (SLA)                   | A service-level agreement defines intervals of time, such as a goal and deadline, that are used to standardize how you resolve work in your application. You can apply a service-level agreement to cases, stages, steps, flows, and assignments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| service process                                 | In Customer Service, a service process is a work flow that starts within an interaction, creates a case, and then guides the user through a process to address the case. The case can be completed during the interaction or can continue processing after the Interaction is completed.

| stream processing                               | Stream processing is the run-time conversion of an HTML or XML text block containing JavaServer Page (JSP) tags or HTML directives into a final form that does not contain JSP tags or directives. JSP tags or directives are evaluated as they are encountered from the start of the string in the context of the current clipboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| sub-report                                      | A subreport is a report that is called by another report to provide data. When you designate a report as a subreport, the original report is not altered, and you can still access it. However, a subreport cannot have its own subreports. You can designate subreports within report definition reports to simplify assembling data from several classes, or to satisfy complex conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Subflow (subprocess)                            | A subprocess, also called a subflow, is a flow that is called by another flow.

| task                                            | In PMF, a task is the work that an operator performs to complete an assignment. Sometimes used to refer to any shape in a flow diagram. Tasks are typically created for a story during or after sprint planning. They can be assigned to individual resources on a team and can be estimated in hours. A scrum best practice is to keep tasks relatively small -- between 4-16 hours per task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| transient property                              | A transient property is a property that is not persisted to the database. Transient properties can have non-null values on the clipboard, but when a clipboard page containing transient properties is saved to the PegaRULES database, the values are removed from the Storage Stream column. Similarly, when an instance containing a transient property is retrieved from the database and opened on the clipboard, the transient properties have no initial values on the clipboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| UI Inspector (Rules Inspector)                  | In Designer Studio, the UI Inspector tool provides you an easy way to locate rules in the user interface. The UI inspector can be configured to indicate UI rules, properties, declaratively set property values, and field values. In versions of PRPC prior to 7.1, the UI Inspector was known as the Rules Inspector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ultimate base class                             | The ultimate base class, identified by the symbol @baseclass, is the topmost class in the class hierarchy.

| WorkManager                                     | A Work Manager is a traditional (compared to Composite) portal that is used by managers and supervisors who want to use the Monitor Activity workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| workstream                                      | A workstream is a collection of specifications that describe a process or subprocess, and the steps that comprise the process. During a DCO session, DCO team members review the contents of the workstream, iterating the specifications and requirements as needed and producing draft flows and draft UI for review. Also referred to as a specification set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Z-ratio                                         | In Decision Management, a Z-ratio is a measure of the reliability of expected behavior (the predicted percentage versus actual behavior) that takes into account errors by allowing for statistical significance. The Z-ratio is positive when expected behavior is above the average behavior and negative when expected behavior is below the average behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
